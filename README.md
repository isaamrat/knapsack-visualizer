## üßÆ The 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Given items with weights and values, find the optimal combination that maximizes total value without exceeding weight capacity.

**Default Example:** 10 items, capacity = 15 units  
**Challenge:** 2^10 = 1,024 possible combinations to explore  
**Applications:** Resource allocation, budgeting, cargo loading, portfolio optimization

## üéì Educational Use Cases

### Classroom Experiments
1. **Parameter Sensitivity** - Run with mutation rates 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and compare
2. **Selection Comparison** - Test Truncation vs Tournament with identical seeds
3. **Crossover Analysis** - Observe one-point vs two-point recombination
4. **Elitism Impact** - Compare runs with elitism = 0, 2, 5, 10

### Research Questions
- How does population size affect convergence speed?
- What's the optimal mutation rate for this problem?
- When does elitism help vs hurt diversity?
- How many generations until stagnation?
